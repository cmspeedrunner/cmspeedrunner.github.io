            <strong><a href="https://tut4it.com/" target="_blank">Tut4IT</a></strong><br />
            This website offers free educational courses from sites like Udemy, where you would potentially pay upwards of $100 for a course, but on Tut4IT, you can find the whole courses avalible for download. Absolute incredible resource.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong><a href="https://freeeducationweb.com/" target="_blank">FreeEducationWeb</a></strong><br />

          <li>
            <strong><a href="https://www.historicfilms.com/" target="_blank">HistoricFilms</a></strong><br />
            History does not lie and we cannot let it be tarnished by the biases and agendas of the modern day evils. Sites like this help to fight against that very process. HistoricFilms features over 50,000 hours of historical stock footage. To license it and use it, obviously there is a charge, but to just wade through the overwhelming catalog, it is 100% free.

          <li>

            Bookracy is a website where you can find free e-books, comics and manga. It has many banned books and previously censored peices of literature such as <i>The Handmaid's Tale</i> (Banned USA) and all of Orwells bibliography (Banned in numerous countries).
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong><a href="https://liber3.eth.limo/" target="_blank">Liber3</a></strong><br />
            Similar to the first entry, Liber3 has a similarly sized database of free and open books.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong><a href="https://www.bookfrom.net/" target="_blank">BookFrom.net</a></strong><br />
            BookFrom.net is once again a simple repository of free books, not much variation in this catagory, which is a good thing at the end of the day.

        <h2>VI. VPN's</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong><a href="https://one.one.one.one/" target="_blank">WARP(1.1.1.1)</a></strong><br />
            Created and maintained by Cloudflare (The largest cybersecurity and web security company in the world), WARP could be considered the perfect VPN. It is free, no adverts, created by guys who clearly know what they are doing <i>(Market cap of 72 Billion dollars)</i> and is user freindly.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong><a href="https://bitmask.net/" target="_blank">Bitmask</a></strong><br />
            Bitmask is a relatively new VPN but still retains a high level of security and privacy all for free. Bitmask's mission statment is based in that non-profit nature and seems to be a great alternative to WARP.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong><a href="https://protonvpn.com/" target="_blank">Proton</a></strong><br />
            ProtonVPN allows you to connect to a VPN with no limit for free. However, if you wish to have customisation, (Country, Internet Speeds and bandwidth), you would have to pay. Proton is an established and verified suite of privacy centered software however, and is a good alternative if you just want the simplest, least configurable service.
