      <h1>About</h1>
      <p>
        The Black Bar Archive is a growing repository of documents, books and information that has been censored or redacted but completely uncensored and unredacted. The BBA attempts to centralize uncensored, true and real information that has or is considered by some to be controversial and therefor has been heavily or absolutely absent on the internet.
        The Black Bar Archive is an open and free collection of information, no money is or will be made and the archive will remain free and open for as long as it remains up.
