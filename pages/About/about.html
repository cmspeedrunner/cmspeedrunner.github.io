      <h1>FAQ</h1>
      <hr/>

      <h2><i>Motive?</i></h2>
      <p>
        The Black Bar Archive exists because access to information is fading at an alarming rate. The Ivory tower that is information is becoming more and more guarded, whether that be locked behind paywalls, a victim of the new online safety bullshit or simply unaccessable for certain people, centralizing these open sources is an act of digital preservation, resistance to obscurity, and an assertion that transparency should not be rare.
      </p>
      <p>Put simply, <i>information is not a privilege, it is a right.</i></p><br>

      <h2><i>Where does the content come from?</i></h2>
      <p>
  The sources are vetted and verified rigorously before ever reaching the site. For every 1 media source on the Black Bar Archive, 100 were discarded at the faintest hint of obscure ethics, suspicious web activity or a general mistrust in the sites operations.
      </p>

      <h2><i>Who runs the site?</i></h2>
      <p>
  The Archive is run by one person, myself and is built from scratch in pure HTML and CSS. Thereâ€™s no company or team just a personal project aimed at keeping valuable media easy to find and free to use.
