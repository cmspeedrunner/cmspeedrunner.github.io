      <h1>About</h1>
      <p>
        The Black Bar Archive is a growing repository of documents, books and information that has been censored or redacted but completely uncensored and unredacted. The BBA attempts to centralize uncensored, true and real information that has or is considered by some to be controversial and therefor has been heavily or absolutely absent on the internet.

       The Black Bar Archive is an <b>open</b> and <b>free</b> collection of information, <b>no</b> money is or will ever be made and the archive will remain free and open for as long as it remains up.

      <h1>FAQ's</h1>
      <hr>
      <h2><i>Motive?</i></h2>
        <p>
        The Black Bar Archive was created because the access of information that is actively under concealment or censorship, is a bastion of
        freedom that is under immense, consistent and ceaseless degradation by powerful and corrupt parties who wish to control and influence the flow of their synthetic truthfulness.
        Manipulating, destroying and censoring information are all integral methods to capture and retain power and control over the population based in manipulation, distrust and string pulling, we cannot let this happen. </p>
        <p>Put simply, <i>information is not a privilege, it is a right.</i></p><br>
      <h2><i>Where is the information sourced?</i></h2>
          <p>
            The information is sourced reliably, for every kilobyte of data that reaches the Black Bar Archive, atleast 1 gigabyte of information has been discarded. Even if a single aspect of a document being vetted is not up to standards expected, it will never see this website ever.
          </p>
          <p>
            As for <i>legality</i>, none of the information on the archive has originated here, this website simply catalogs and organises already existing information.
          </p>
      <h2><i>Who runs BBA?</i></h2>
          <p>
            The website has been built from scratch in HTML and CSS by me. It is maintained by me and updated, expanded and tweaked daily by myself. Identity of course will remain less transparent.
