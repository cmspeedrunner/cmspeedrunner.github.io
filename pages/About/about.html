      <h1>About</h1>
      <p>
        The Black Bar Archive is a growing repository of documents, books and information that has been censored or redacted but completely uncensored and unredacted. The BBA attempts to centralize uncensored, true and real information that has or is considered by some to be controversial and therefor has been heavily or absolutely absent on the internet.
        
      </p>
      <p>
       The Black Bar Archive is an <b>open</b> and <b>free</b> collection of information, <b>no</b> money is or will ever be made and the archive will remain free and open for as long as it remains up.
      </p>
      <h2>Values</h2>
      <ul class="about-list">
        <li>Open and accessible information.</li>
        <li>Only real, geniune and verified information is hosted here.</li>
        <li>The BBA will never cost a cent to use in any capacity.</li>
        <li>Unwaivering confidence in freedom of expression.</li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Motive</h2>
      <p>
The Black Bar Archive was created because the access of information that is actively under concealment or censorship, is a bastion of
freedom that is under immense, consistent and ceaseless degradation by powerful and corrupt parties who wish to control and influence the flow of their synthetic truthfulness.
Manipulating, destroying and censoring information are all integral methods to capture and retain power and control over the population based in manipulation, distrust and string pulling, we cannot let this happen. Information is not a privilege, it is a right.</p>
