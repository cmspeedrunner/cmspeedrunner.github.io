        Despite being officially created on the 2nd of August 2025, the idea and concepts that would eventually culminate in the <i>Black Bar Archive</i> floated around my mind many years earlier.
        <br><br>
        I never pulled the trigger though, as web development was honestly a mess at the time and the most prominent reason was; <i>I had no real reason to create something like this.</i>
        <br><br>
        That was, of course, until the Government Of the United Kingdom released perhaps the most blantant example of legislature corruption yet, the Online Safety Act.

        <br><br>
        My issue is less with the bill itself, but what intentions truly hid behind this powerful bill. It was no less then a few weeks of the the Online Safety Act being in effect until the true weaponisation of censorship was seen. The Government brigaded a seemingly well meaning piece of legislature, intended to keep children safe,
        <br><br>
        When <i>in reality</i> it was a kneejerk reaction in attempts to <strong>censor and manipulate the truth</strong> with what is happening in Gaza.

        <br><br>
        <i>A genocide, mind you.</i>
        <br><br>
        It was at this point, I found a reason to create this project. <b>Black Bar</b> reffering to the <i>CIA Black Bars</i> used to censor and redact information
        <br><br>
        I intend to grow the archive, to make information as accesable and free as possible, with not a single cent being made. 
        <br><br>
        And no, I am not expecting this project to have an impact, change much or even be noticed. I created this project mainly for me, it's the website I want to see on the internet, especially in the current climate.
        <br><br>
        The Project is never finished, I plan to expand on it for as long as it stays up.
